# Linear Regression Reflection

In Linear Regression , the target values, which we want to predict, 'Sales' will be reflected upon the varying of coefficient of the features 'TV','Radio' and 'Newspaper', as in order in this dataset
After carefully observing about the coefficient and intercept of Linear Regression in print statement, we get  
TV - 3.68334078  
Radio - 2.90625242  
Newspaper - 0.14194772
Intercept - 14.497142857142856 accordingly.

So that,
(a) - **The least impact** on the sales volumes is **Newspaper Channel** , which only have the coefficient of _0.14194772_, meaning we could expect almost zero times on sales volume no matter how much we spend the adv.budget on this channel.
(b) - The sales volumes fluctuation is mostly depends upon the 'TV Channel' which has the biggest coefficient of 3.68 times which is underscoring about _every one dollar we spent on the budget, the sales volume increase 3.68 times in return.
