(1)Which model gives you better performance: Multiple Linear Regression or Polynomial Regression?
    I compared Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression (Degree 2) for house price prediction, evaluating their R², MSE, and MAE on training and test data.
    While Polynomial Regression performed slightly better on training data, Multiple Linear Regression proved better on test data.
    Multiple Linear Regression achieved a higher Test R² and lower errors, showing better generalization. 
    Higher-degree Polynomial models severely overfit, failing completely on new data.
    Multiple Linear Regression is the better, more reliable model due to its stronger generalization and ability to avoid overfitting.

(2)How do you decide the optimal degree for Polynomial Regression in this case?
        To determine the optimal polynomial degree, I evaluated model performance from degree 2 to 8 using a train-test split. 
    The primary criterion was the Test R² score, which measures how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
    My analysis showed that Degree 2 achieved the best Test R² score (0.25). Higher degrees clearly overfit the training data and performed poorly on the test set. 
    Therefore, Degree 2 was selected as the optimal polynomial degree in this case.
        Risks of choosing the wrong degree:
        Underfitting (too low degree): The model is too simple to capture important patterns, leading to poor performance on both training and new data.
        Overfitting (too high degree): The model becomes too complex, learns noise from the training data, and performs poorly on unseen data.
