1. Differences Between the Three Naive Bayes Classifiers
GaussianNB:Assumes that features follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution. Suitable for continuous data.
MultinomialNB:Designed for count-based or discrete data (e.g., word counts in text classification).
BernoulliNB:Designed for binary/boolean features. Models the presence or absence of a feature rather than its count.
2. Precision and Recall Comparison
GaussianNB has high recall (0.86) for fraudulent transactions (Class 1), meaning it catches most fraud cases.
MultinomialNB fails to detect fraud (recall = 0), despite slightly higher overall accuracy.
BernoulliNB achieves high precision (0.93) and decent recall (0.73), balancing false positives and detection.
3. Model Choice for Fraud DetectionIn fraud detection, the main priority is to detect as many fraudulent transactions as possible (high recall), while keeping false alarms reasonable.
GaussianNB is strong in recall (0.86) but has lower precision (0.38), meaning more false positives.
BernoulliNB provides a good balance: high precision (0.93) and reasonably high recall (0.73), reducing false positives while still catching most fraud.
MultinomialNB is not suitable for this dataset as it fails to detect fraud.
BernoulliNB is the recommended model for fraud detection in this case because it balances precision and recall effectively, making it reliable for practical use.
