## Learning the Basics of Machine Learning

This project shows how I'm learning the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning. I'm focusing on understanding these key areas:

* **Core Algorithms:** Learning how basic algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Descent (which you'll see in this project) work.
* **Math Behind It:** Understanding the essential math (like algebra, calculus, and statistics) that explains why these algorithms function.
* **Preparing Data:** Learning methods for cleaning, organizing, and getting data ready for machine learning models.

I'll keep updating this README as I continue my learning journey in Machine Learning.
