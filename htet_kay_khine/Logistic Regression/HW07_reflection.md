What’s the difference between polynomial/linear regression and logistic regression?
Explain when you would use each one and how their outputs are different.

Difference between Polynomial/Linear Regression and Logistic Regression:
Linear Regression models the relationship between input variables and a continuous target using a straight line. 
Polynomial Regression extends linear regression by including powers of the input features to model nonlinear (curved) relationships, but it’s still linear in coefficients.
Logistic Regression is used for classification tasks. Instead of predicting continuous values, it predicts the probability that an input belongs to a particular class by applying the sigmoid function to output values between 0 and 1.

Linear and polynomial regressions estimate continuous targets; polynomials add nonlinear terms to capture curves .Logistic regression predicts class membership by outputting probabilities between 0 and 1 via a sigmoid function.Linear or polynomial regressions are more suitable for continuous predictions problems and logistic regression is the most appropriate for classification tasks.
