HW04

a) Which advertising channel has the least impact on sales volume?
Provide evidence from your analysis and explain your reasoning.

Newspaper has the least impact on sales volume because its coefficient is the smallest and close to zero [3.68334078 2.90625242 0.14194772].A small coefficient means a least impact on the target variable(sales).Since the coefficient for newspaper is much smaller than those for TV and radio, it contributes very little to the predicted sales.

b) If we increase the amount spent on TV advertising by one dollar, while keeping the amounts spent on radio and newspaper advertising constant, what will be the expected change in sales volume?
Support your answer with your findings and explain your reasoning clearly.

If we increase spending on TV advertising by one dollar, the expected increase in sales is approximately 3.68334078 units, assuming radio and newspaper spending remain constant.
By calculating dividing TV coefficient from scaled model and Standard deviation of TV, expected increase can be obtained.Since R2 score on training data and test data are 0.9 and 0.8, R2 closes to zero. Therefore,the model is fit and performing well.
